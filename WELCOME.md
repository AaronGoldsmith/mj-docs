# Welcome to Midjourney
Midjourney is a new research lab focused on new mediums and tools for empowering people.

 ### Code of Conduct
- Don't be a jerk
- Don't use our tools to make images that could inflame, upset, or cause drama. That includes gore and adult content.
- Be respectful

Make sure you are familiar with the [Full Content Guidelines](unacceptable-content-and-moderation.md).  

You can also find more detail within the Midjourney Discord server in the #rules, #faq, #announcements, and #status channels.

## Create your First Image.
Once you have joined the Discord server you will be able to create a limited number of (about 25) images before needing to subscribe. 

#### 1. Select one of the `#Newbies` channels from the sidebar.
![Select a Newbies Channel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/167752981-596a4819-163b-4c4c-9241-adfd6231a1f4.jpg)

<br/>


#### 2. Use the /Imagine Command.

To use the Midjourney Bot use a [Discord Slash Command](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) and type`/imagine`.
Immediately after typing `/imagine` press spacebar, tab, or enter to create the **prompt** field.
Slash Commands will only work in *Bot Channels*. Typing `/Imagine` will not work in general channels like `#Support`.

<br/>


#### 3. Wait as the MidJourney Bot Processes Your Request
Requests take a minute to generate four options based on your prompt.

<br/>


#### 4. Upscale your Image.
Two rows of buttons will appear 
The top row of buttons: `U1` `U2` `U3` and `U4` are buttons for **upscaling** your chosen image.
Upscaling an image generates a larger roughly 1024x1024 pixel version of the selected image while adding additional details.

#### 5. Save Your Image.

Your upscaled image (and 2x2 grid images) will immediately be visible on [gallery.midjourney.com](https://gallery.midjourney.com/)


</br>


#### 6 Send Results to Your DMs.

You can also react with the ✉️ emoji to direct message your upscaled image (or 2x2 grid images) to yourself using the Midjourney bot.

#### 7 Start a Thread.

If you want a quieter place to work you can start your own thread in any of the bot channels. Note, they are still public and subject to content moderation guidelines.

![create thread](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/168845499-7f721e51-ee24-434e-97fd-856e9c883238.gif)

#### 8 Have Questions?

If you have other questions you can find many answers in the `#announcements`, `#status`, `#rules`, `#faq`, and `#docs` channels.
If you still need help post your question in the `#support` channel.
