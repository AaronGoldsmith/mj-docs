## Derived Art Product Sales
More info coming soon, please see #rules channel for more info. 


#### Can I sell a product outside of the commercial terms if it's a derived product (e.g. 3d modelling based off an image, paint-over)?

It's safer to treat derived images as covered by the current commercial terms. Special projects can be discussed case-by-case.
