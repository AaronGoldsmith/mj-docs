## Where Is It?

If you are a subscriber, you can acess it (logged in with Discord credentials) at [midjourney.com/app](https://www.midjourney.com/app/).

## What's the Feed?

The ["feed"](https://www.midjourney.com/app/feed/) is the community record of public upscales, which includes DMs with the bot that are not paid /private usage.  If you mouse over an image, you will see the prompt.


## Image LeaderBoards and Rating

Nominate your own images (by rating them) or rate other people's images at:
[https://midjourney.com/app/ranking/](https://midjourney.com/app/ranking/)

There will be prizes for winning images and members who rate large numbers of images. (WARNING: Random button mashing on ratings will be considered 'hostile' and may get you banned (don't worry otherwise, though!) 

Prizes will include $40 packs of fast-gpu hours.

We will use these ratings to improve our AI so ratings are 'serious'.

## Viewing Great Images!

If you want to see the top ranked images, go to [www.midjourney.com/app/ranking/feed/](https://www.midjourney.com/app/ranking/feed/).

Also there is the [Favorites Gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/app/feed/favorites/), created when you and others give images a star rating.

## Dictionary

Available under the "More" menu button, the dictionary shows the output of single word prompts.

## Styles and Artists

Available in [Styles](https://www.midjourney.com/app/library/styles/), you can find examples of artist and style applications.  Styles that aren't shown here will still probably work for you, though.

## Account and Subscription Settings

On the top right corner is your user icon. Click on it to find "Manage Plan."  [This page](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) is your account settings and billing options.  There are some subscription FAQs at the bottom.

We use Stripe for credit card processing.
