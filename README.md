## Create your First Image 
Once you have joined the Discord server you will be able to create a limited number of images before needing to subscribe. 

#### 1. Select one of the `#Newbies` channels from the sidebar.
![Select a Newbies Channel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/167752981-596a4819-163b-4c4c-9241-adfd6231a1f4.jpg)

<br/>


#### 2. Use the /Imagine command

To use the Midjourney Bot use a [Discord Slash Command](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) and type`/imagine`.
Immediately after typing `/imagine` press spacebar, tab, or enter to create the **prompt** field.
Slash Commands will only work in *Bot Channels*. Typing `/Imagine` will not work in `#Support`, `#Discussion,` and other general channels.

#### 3. Wait as the MidJourney Bot Processes your Request
Requests take a minute to generate four options based on your prompt.

#### 4. Upscale an Image
Two rows of buttons will appear 
The top row of buttons: `U1` `U2` `U3` and `U4` are buttons for **upscaling** your chosen image.
Upscaling an image generates a 1024x1024 pixel version of the selected image while adding additional details.

Your upscaled image will immediately be visible on [gallery.midjourney.com](https://gallery.midjourney.com/)\
You can also react with the ✉️ emoji to direct message your image to yourself using the Midjourney bot.
