Q: How do I DM the bot?

The easiest way to initiate a DM conversation with the bot is to reply to a generation you made in a bot channel with the envelope emoji, :envelope:, and it will open a DM conversation with you in Discord. You will have to find it in your Discord Home, where Direct Messages and listed. Click on the MidJourney Bot. Now you can use the `/imagine` command and other commands listed below. Please note the images will still appear on your gallery unless you use /private.

You can also right-click on the bot in any bot channel, and you should see the option to message the bot.

---

Q: I thought my DM images were private. Why are they being moderated?

Images created in DMs and with `/private` are still viewable by moderators and the midjourney team.

---

Q: Why don't I see any messages from the bot? I used used ✉️ on one of my images, why don't I see any messages from the bot? 

Right-click on the server -> Privacy settings -> Allow direct messages from server members.

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961148616884506674/981338414479712356/Discord_vCUySZbwMa.gif

---

Q: How do I create a thread?

Click on the icon with the # on top of a bot channel. It will allow you to view and create threads. Note, they are still public and subject to content moderation guidelines.Discord has a limit on the number of threads per server, so you may need to try again later to get an open spot.

%image=https://support.discord.com/hc/article\_attachments/4403200565911/create\_thread.gif

---

Q: What's a bot channel?

Any channel where you can use the `/imagine` command and make images. On the Discord server, they are marked as "Image Generation" channels. Most commands below require you to be in a bot channel.

---

Q: Do the different bot channels have different image generation settings?

No, the bot is the same in all of them.

---

Q: What exactly does the ↻ button do?

The ↻ submits the same job again, which will run with a different seed. You will see more variations.

---

Q: I'm having trouble using the bot - how do I use /imagine?

When you type `/imagine` try clicking on the box that pops up that says "prompt". It should say `/imagine` prompt then type what you want. See the image below

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961148616884506674/969225978356326470/ImaginePrompt.gif

If you don't see the /imagine option, update your Discord app, re-log-in, and check your subscription. 

---

Q: How do I see how many gpu hours I have left?

Use `/info` in a bot channel to check your subscription status and usage.

---

Q: How do I see how many images I have left?

Use `/info` in a bot channel to check your subscription status and usage.

---
Q: My images say "relaxed", how do I change this?

Use `/fast` in a bot channel. This will enable fast generation, but you will be incrementally charged for each image if you are out of fast credits.

---

Q: My images say "metered, fast". I don't want to be charged!

Use `/relax` in a bot channel. This will cost you nothing but images will take longer to generate.

---

Q: I don't want anyone to see my images and prompts.

Use `/private` and work in your DMs. This will make your images private and hidden from the website, but costs more. It's a subscription upgrade.

---

Q: How many jobs can be generating at once?

You can have 3 jobs going at once (of any kind, 2x2, upscale etc). If you submit a 4th job or more, you will get a message and your job will be started as soon as another one finishes

---

Q: How many concurrent jobs can I run? How many can I queue?

You can generate 3 images at once. If you start more jobs you'll get a message saying "your job will start shortly". You can start 10 jobs before your queue is full. If you are in relax mode this decreases to 2 concurrent images at once.

---

Q: What is a "friend pass"?

With your subscription plan, you get a limited number of invitations you can send friends to invite them to try Midjourney.  The `/info` command should show you how many you have to give. We give out more each month. You will use the `/invite` command as shown below.

---

Q: How do I know how many invites I have left?

Use the `/info` command to see your plan usage including invites available.

---

Q: How do I invite someone?

In a bot channel, type `/invite`. It will create a one-time use link for you to copy and send to the person you want to invite. You do not need to provide their email or user name. Don't lose it! It will expire after 24 hours.

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961148616884506674/973955120721174538/invite2.gif

---

Q: The upscale adds too much detail. How can I just change the resolution of one of the image from the 2x2 preview grid?

React to your image with :envelope: and it will send you the separate images in DM. You can then change the resolution using a program on your computer.

---

Q How can I prevent preview and upscale to add too much details?

You can use `--stop 80` and replace `80` with the % you want to stop at. Use `--uplight` for the upscale to add less details, or redo it with the button "Light Upscale Redo" afterwards.

---

Q: Is there any way to upscale an image and get the video of the process/final result using the --video command

We don't support videos for upscaling right now.

---

Q: I don't see the Max Upscale option.

This feature is only available in /fast mode and when --w and --h are under 512.

---

Q: What is "Light Upscale Redo"?

This option redoes the upscaling, with a different algorithm that adds less detail, which you may prefer.

---

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution?

3 megapixels.

---

Q: What is 'fast-mode'? What does fast-hours mean?

We have two modes for image generation, “fast” and “relax”. Fast tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's our highest priority processing tier, and it's kinda expensive. “Relax” puts you in a queue behind others based on how much you’ve used the system.

Right now, we give 15 gpu-hours/mo of ‘fast’ with the ‘Standard’ plan and 200 gpu-minutes/mo with the ‘Basic’ plan.

One hour is roughly 60 image generation or upscale commands and roughly 200 image variation commands.

These numbers are super experimental and may change at any time.

---

Q: How do I get the seed or job id that was used for an image (e.g. so I can report a bug or so I can reuse it to generate a similar image)?

React to your image with the envelope emoji :envelope: and it will send it to you in DM.

%image=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/167305579-1b2c461f-03d7-4aad-b14e-9ce0dd74fd9a.png

---

Q: Are the 4 initial images generated with the same seed?

In a way, yes. We use the seed to generate noise (think randomness) for all 4 images at once so the noise is different for each image.

---

Q: Does submitting the job again use a different seed?

Yes, unless you specify --seed with a number.

---

Q: What exactly does --seed stabilize?

Seed means that the random noise we add during the initialization of the generation will be the same each time but GPUs are non-deterministic, so the images won't look exactly the same.

---

Q: Certain dimensions specified with —h y —w x will generate less images than the normal 4 (3 to 1), is there some reason for this?

The GPUs we use have a finite amount of memory; larger images means each one takes up more memory so we have to generate less.

---

Q: Where is the gallery?

Go to [https://www.midjourney.com/app/](https://www.midjourney.com/app/). You can also read more about the web app here [Midjourney Web App](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/web-app). 

---

Q: Is there a way to save all my images at once?

We don't have a batch download feature yet. The fastest is to go to your web gallery feed, open an image, then click on the save icon. You can use the right arrow to move to the next image and repeat the operation.

---

Q: What is the Feed?

The Feed is the public record of all upscaled community images. This includes images created in DMs with the bot, and is subject to moderation review. Only if you are in Private (a higher subscription level) will your upscales not show up in the Feed.

---

Q: How can I attach an image as inspiration?

Type `/imagine` prompt as normal, but then in the prompt section, paste in the web address where the image is stored online. After the link you can still add new text prompts to complement it.  You can see some examples in the Imagine Parameters visual guide [here](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/imagine-parameters#image-prompting-with-url).

An image url must be a direct link to an online image, which you can usually get by right clicking on an image somewhere and choosing `Copy Link Address`. This address will usually end in a `.png` or `.jpg` if it's a usable address.

---

Q: Any tips regarding using two image sources? The results seem quite random... Is there any way to influence what those two images are doing?

We don't currently support adding individual weights for images, so the most you can do is just set the global image weight with --iw.

---

Q: Is there a way to get the "image prompt" to be closer to the initial image, just like "make variations"?

Your best bet is to increase the image weight. Check https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/faqs#image-prompt-questions for more details.

---

Q: What's the max size I can use for an image prompt? I keep getting this error "Job encountered an error, likely due to lack of memory".

Your problem is more likely due to not using a plain image page as the image prompt. Make sure it's a public url with an ending of .png or .jpg, not an html page with an image on it somewhere.  You can find the actual source image with a right-click and "Copy Image Address" (or "Copy Image Link").

---

Q: Is it possible to choose how much weight is applied to each image using --iw?

The weight specified is applied on all image prompts given to the bot.

---

Q: Can an image prompt have a negative weight?

Yes, with --iw -0.5.

---

Q: How do I upload or use an image from my hard-drive for an image prompt?

It needs to be online, with a public URL, which you can do using Discord. If it's already online somewhere, right click on the image to 'copy image address (or link)' and go to step 5:

On desktop:

1. Drag an image into Discord
2. Press enter to send it in the chat
3. Click the image in discord so that it's fullscreen
4. Right click it and press "copy image address"
5. Type `/imagine` and then paste the address in the prompt area.

On Mobile:

1. Push the plus in the lower left then click 'upload'
2. Press 'send message' to send it into the chat
3. Click the image in discord so that it's fullscreen
4. Push share then click 'copy url'
5. Type `/imagine` and then paste the address in the prompt area.

---

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from the way some other tools do?

Some image generation tools can take a starting image as the source and modify it. They often call this an "init\_image."  This is not supported by Midjourney at the moment. You can use a url as part of your prompt, along with text if you want, but it is more of an "influence image" than a true init.. [Here is a short guide on using image prompts](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/faqs#image-prompt-questions)
---

Q: Any tips for successful text prompts? How do I write better prompts?

Here is a short guide on effective text prompts: [Tips on Text Prompts](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/resource-links/guide-to-prompting).

---

Q: Is letter case (caps vs lowercase) taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt?

No, everything is case-insensitive.

---

Q: How do you weigh text prompts?

Check out the explainer over on the changelog in #status: [Explainer](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/942231458918064148/960181257394868224).  Basically, it says:

You can suffix any part of the prompt with `::0.5` to give that part a weight of 0.5. If the weight is not specified, it defaults to 1;

Some examples: `/imagine hot dog::2 food::-1` - This sends a text prompt of `hot dog` with the weight 2 and `food` of weight -1.

`/imagine hot dog::0.5 animal::-0.25` - This sends `hot dog` of weight 0.5 and `animal` of negative 0.25.

`/imagine hot dog:: food::-1 animal::` - Sends `hot dog` of weight 1, `food` of weight -1 and `animal` of weight 1 (unspecified weights default to 1).

Watch out for prompts such as `/imagine hot dog animal::0.5`, as this will send the prompt of `hot dog animal` with weight 0.5, because of how it parses the text before the colons.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter?

Yes, the model considers them like a break in the prompt, but it's not always clear what impact this will have. Use `::` between prompts for a hard separator.

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write?

Anything over around 60 words will not affect the output, so don't write a novel. (It must stay under 6000 characters.)

---

Q: Why am I getting a message that says "Job encountered an error, likely due to lack of memory"?

Try using --w and --h as multiple of 64 and under 1024, e.g. `--w 256 --h 320`

---

Q: "Cannot send messages to this user" when trying to DM the bot

Go to Discord privacy settings for this server and toggle this on:

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958069758211797092/979275401249574952/unknown.png

---

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Interaction Failed"?

The job will (probably) still go through, but it will not show the intermediate images. If you get this with your DMs with the bot, make sure your security settings allow DMs.

---

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Server has reached limit of active threads"?

We reached the max number of threads we can create on the server. it will be possible to add new threads when older threads will archive. In the meantime, feel free to work in Direct Messages with the bot.

---

Q: Why can't I see the /imagine option as a slash command?

Especially on mobile, you may need to update the app (via the app store etc) and restart it. Then try the / prompt in a bot channel and see if the /imagine option is listed. Otherwise, is your account subscription active? Try /info to see your status.

---

Q: Is there a roadmap?

There is currently no published roadmap

---

Q: How do I change my aspect ratio?

Use the --ar 3:4 parameter (or your desired aspect ratio).  It should look like this:
/Imagen prompt: cyberpunk cats --ar 2:3

---

Q: Is there a roadmap?

Is there a way to add more parameters to a generated image AFTER you've been generated different versions

It is not currently possible to modify a prompt after it has been used

---

Q. Do fast hours roll over?

Fast hours do not roll over month to month

---
Q. Is there a list of banned words

The banned word list is not publicly available.


---

Q. Can I pay with Paypal?

Only payment methods that work with Stripe are currently supported

---

Q. Does my free trial ever renew?

No, trial time does not renew.

---

Q. Do subscriptions renew on the first of the month?

Subscriptions renew every 30 days.

---
Q. How do I subscribe?

Type /subscribe and click the link provided or go to [https://www.midjourney.com/account/](https://www.midjourney.com/account/)
