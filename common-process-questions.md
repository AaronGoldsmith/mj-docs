# Common process questions

**Q: Can I sell a product outside of the commercial terms if it's a derived product (e.g. 3d modelling based off an image, paint over)?**

It's safer to treat derived images as covered by the current commercial terms. Special projects can be discussed case-by-case.

**Q: Why is the keyword X banned?**

We're working on a better moderating system. For now banning words has proven an effective way to prevent abuses. Some words sound safe but are bringing the model in unexpectedly corners in a consistent way. Trying to get around banned words for generating nsfw images is a breach of our guidelines, but it is fine when the intent is compliant with the guidelines.

**Q: How do I get the seed or job id that was used for an image (e.g. so I can report a bug or so I can reuse it to generate a similar image)?**

React to your image with :envelope: and it will send it to you in DM
