**Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter?**

A: Yes, the model considers them like a break in the prompt, but it's not always clear what impact this will have.
Use `::` between prompts for a hard separator as describe in the answer above.

**Q: What is the length limit for prompts?**

A: Anything over around 60 words will not affect the output, so don't write a novel. (It must stay under 6000 characters.)
